# Heart Attack Prediction

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to create a prediction model of heart attacks. This model can be used to predict whether a patient will experience a heart attack or not based on pre-existing symptoms.

## Process
### EDA
First, exploratory data analysis was performed, where the raw dataset was examined along with its variables.
### Feature Engineering
Some new features were created using combinations/manipulations of existing features to be suitable for modeling.
### Modeling
A logistic regression algorithm was used for this prediction model.

## Results
The model perforance was evaluated with the following parameters: log loss of 0.4, AUC score of 0.9, and an average precision of 0.9. Overall, the model portrays adequate performance with little room for improvements. A larger dataset would improve the performance of the model.
